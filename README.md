## Work in Progress
I have learned about JWT Token before but never implemented it myself.

This repo is going to include a simple sign-in page, a landing page where user are required to click a button to stay signed in. Or else, the app will automatically sign out for you within a certain period of time.

The landing page will also include a refresh button which will forcefully refresh you web browser page, if you token haven't expired then you will remain signed in. Or else, it will redirect you to the login page again.

This little app will also be the first time experimenting with tailwindcss.
