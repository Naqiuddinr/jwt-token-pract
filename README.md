## Work in Progress
I have learned about JWT Token before but never implemented it myself.

This repo is going to include a simple sign-in page, a landing page where user are required to read some instruction and click a button at the bottom of the message to stay signed in. Or else, the app will automatically sign out for you within a certain period of time.

This little app will also be the first time experimenting with tailwindcss and some other new UI libraries.
